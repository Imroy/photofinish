This will be a port of 'process' from Perl to C++.

== Differences ==

* Written in C/C++
* Use various low-level libraries instead of going through ImageMagick
* Do proper processing in a linear colour space

== Libraries ==

* LibPNG for reading scans and optionally producing final output
* IJG's LibJPEG for writing JPEG's
* Little CMS (LCMS) for converting between colour profiles
* libyaml for reading YAML data files
* EXIV for EXIF data
* Boost?

== Process ==

# Read list of destination configuration from 'destinations.yml'
# Read input image
# Read tag data for the input image
# Decide on which 'target' to use for scaling
# Scale the image
# Scale image for thumbnail
# Save output image with metadata
