= Datasource =

* Holds data (in derived classes)
* Is produced by a processor (not tracked)
* Has any number of processors waiting for its data
* Starts as 'empty', becomes 'available' when its data is all filled in
* When that happens, all of its dependent processors are notified


== Sub-class examples ==

* Image rows
* Resampler coefficients
* Image planes (for the ditherer)


= Processor =

* Processes data from any number of datasources (in derived classes)
* Starts as 'waiting', become 'ready' when all of its datasources are 'available', and is then 'done'


== Sub-class examples ==

* Image format readers and writers
* Colour space transformer
* Rescalers
* Ditherer


= Action =

* Is called by processors to queue up the next set of datasources and processors when they're done
* Allows the datasource and processor classes to remain generic about how things are to procede
* Would be set up by the program


= Workqueue =

* Is an object held by the program
* Keeps lists of datasources and processors
* Holds a lock so that it is thread-safe
* Threads pull out ready processors for execution and call methods to maintain the lists
* Actions add new datasources and processors to the queue
