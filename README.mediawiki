Photo Finish is a command-line tool for automatically processing digital images in the (presumably) last stage of publishing a photo. I run a "hybrid" workflow that starts with film scans, but this could also be of use to digital photographers.


== Description ==

So what does Photo Finish do?

# It decides on the correct cropping window for a specified "destination"
# Does the crop and rescaling
# Saves the result with custom EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata


== Features ==

My focus has been on image quality and correctness, so many computations are done in floating-point. The 1990's are long passed, so why limit ourselves to small integers? We have the computational power and memory storage to easily do this the right way.


* The list of "destinations" is read from a YAML file
** Destinations describe the size, format, and other specifics of the output
* Each input file can have its own list of "tags" - EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata, as well as "variables", some of which override destination parameters
** This is an artefact of my original shell script (which used exiftool) and expanded in my Perl version (using [http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ Image::Exiftool]); perhaps this should be replaced by YAML?


=== Image file formats ===

* Reads and writes JPEG, PNG, and TIFF files
* Embedded ICC profiles are used when reading, and created when writing
* Falls back to sRGB or a similar greyscale profile
* Reads CMYK image data from JPEG and TIFF files (requires an embedded ICC profile)


=== Data structures and processing ===

* Image pixel data is stored internally in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space CIE L*a*b* colour space] using floating-point components
** This colour space is perceptually uniform, so it is ideal for rescaling of images
** Even when the input and output(s) are greyscale, this colour space is used (partly for simplicity, but also because greyscale can have colour to it)
** Configurable as either single or double precision at compile-time (DP adds almost nothing in my limited tests)
* Rescaling is done using a Lanczos filter
* OpenMP is used in several places to take advantage of SMP systems
* Dithers using Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion when producing 8-bit component output
** Not sure if this improves the output or not, it just seemed like the right thing to do


== Current limitations ==

* Probably only compiles on Linux for now


== Todo ==

* Add other image formats e.g JPEG 2000, RAW formats (reading only)
* Use YAML (or something else?) for the "tags" format

Crazy idea:
* An entirely workqueue-based version to keep multiple processors/cores busy at all time


== Libraries ==

Photo Finish currently uses the following libraries:
* [http://www.libpng.org/ LibPNG] for reading and writing PNG files
* [http://www.ijg.org/ IJG]'s LibJPEG for writing JPEG's
* [http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/ libTIFF] for reading and writing PNG files
* [http://www.littlecms.com/ Little CMS] (LCMS) for transforming between colour profiles
* [http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/ libyaml] for reading YAML data files
* [http://www.exiv2.org/ EXIV] for EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata
* Several boost libraries:
** [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/filesystem/doc/ Boost.Filesystem]
** [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/doc/html/program_options.html Boost.Program_options]
** [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/doc/html/boost_lexical_cast.html Boost.Lexical_Cast]
** a bit of [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/algorithm/doc/html/index.html Boost.Algorithm] (iequals)
